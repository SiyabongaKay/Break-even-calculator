🌍 SaaS Break-Even Calculator Web App
For EdTech Platforms in South Africa

🎯 Purpose
Design and develop an interactive SaaS Break-Even Calculator tailored for ed-tech startups and scale-ups operating in South Africa. The tool will help product managers, founders, and financial planners forecast monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and calculate when their platform reaches break-even, based on customizable assumptions.

This application will serve internal strategy sessions and investor presentations by validating pricing models, scaling assumptions, and customer acquisition expectations.

✅ Core Features
1. 🔢 User Input Interface
Design an intuitive and clean input form that captures the following fields:

Input Field	Description
Fixed Monthly Costs (ZAR)	E.g., salaries, servers, support, marketing
Price per Learner	Monthly subscription fee per active learner
Variable Cost per Learner	Costs like cloud hosting, support, SMS, content delivery
Initial Learner Count	Number of paying learners in month 1
Monthly Growth Rate (%)	Expected learner acquisition rate month-over-month
Monthly Churn Rate (%)	Learners dropping off platform per month

🎛 Optional: Use sliders for growth/churn, currency input fields for pricing/costs

2. 📈 Calculation Logic
The backend logic should calculate:

📌 Contribution Margin:
sql
Copy
Edit
Contribution Margin = Price per Learner - Variable Cost per Learner
📌 Break-even Learner Count:
mathematica
Copy
Edit
Break-even Learners = Fixed Monthly Costs ÷ Contribution Margin
Break-even MRR = Break-even Learners × Price per Learner
📌 Contribution Margin Ratio:
java
Copy
Edit
CM Ratio = (Contribution Margin ÷ Price per Learner) × 100
Break-even Sales (ZAR) = Fixed Costs ÷ (CM Ratio ÷ 100)
3. 📅 12-Month Forecast Simulation
Simulate user growth and churn over 12 months:

python
Copy
Edit
For month in range(1, 13):
    learners = previous_learners + (growth_rate × previous_learners) - (churn_rate × previous_learners)
    mrr = learners × price_per_learner
Store each month’s:

Active Learner Count

MRR

4. 📊 Output & Visualization
Display the following:

📈 Line Chart of MRR over 12 months (use Recharts or Chart.js)

📍 Break-even point overlay on the chart:
